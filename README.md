# Magnetrix-io: High-Frequency Ferrite Inductor Design Web App

Welcome to Magnetrix-io! This web application empowers users to design high-frequency ferrite inductors by specifying RMS current, peak current, and required inductance. The app provides a stylized form for inputting design parameters and presents a list of available ferrite cores. Users can then view design details for each core, including power losses and resistance associated with the specific design.
